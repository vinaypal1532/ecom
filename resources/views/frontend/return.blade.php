                    <p>At Fruitables, we are committed to ensuring your satisfaction with every purchase. If you are not completely satisfied with your order, our Return & Refund Policy outlines the process for returning products and receiving a refund.</p>

                    <h3>Returns</h3>
                    <p>If you wish to return a product, you may do so within 7 days of receiving your order. The product must be unused, in its original packaging, and in the same condition as received. Perishable goods, such as fruits and vegetables, are not eligible for returns.</p>

                    <h3>Refunds</h3>
                    <p>Once we receive your returned product, we will inspect it and notify you of the status of your refund. If your return is approved, we will initiate a refund to your original method of payment within a certain number of days, depending on your payment provider's policies.</p>

                    <h3>Exceptions</h3>
                    <p>Several types of goods are exempt from being returned. Perishable goods such as food items, flowers, newspapers, or magazines cannot be returned. We also do not accept products that are intimate or sanitary goods, hazardous materials, or flammable liquids or gases.</p>

                    <h3>Shipping</h3>
                    <p>You will be responsible for paying for your own shipping costs for returning your item. Shipping costs are non-refundable. If you receive a refund, the cost of return shipping will be deducted from your refund.</p>
